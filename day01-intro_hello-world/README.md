# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?
## What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions for a computer to follow. It involves writing code in a specific programming language that tells the computer what to do.

## What is Python?
- It is a high-level, interpreted language, meaning that it is relatively easy for humans to read and write, but requires an interpreter to be run on a computer.
- Python is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
- Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
- Python has a large and active community of developers and users, who contribute to the development of the language and create a wealth of resources and libraries to use.

# What Is Hello World Program In Paython?

The **Hello, World!** program is a simple program that displays the text **Hello, World!** on the screen. In Python, it would look like this:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code uses the `print()` function, which takes a **string (in this case, "Hello, World!") as an argument** and displays it on the screen.

To run this program, you would need to save it to a file with a `.py` extension `(e.g. hello.py)` and then use a Python interpreter to execute the code. You can do this from the command line by typing:-
```
python hello.py
```
 and pressing enter. The output of the program should be  
  `Hello, World!`  
  displayed on the screen.
